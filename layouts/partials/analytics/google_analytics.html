{{/*
  Local override for Wowchemy analytics partial.
  Some Wowchemy versions attempt to access .Site.GoogleAnalytics in a way
  that fails during local builds for certain config shapes. Creating this
  empty partial in the project overrides the theme's partial and prevents
  render errors. If you want Google Analytics, replace the contents below
  with the standard GA snippet and set your ID in config.
