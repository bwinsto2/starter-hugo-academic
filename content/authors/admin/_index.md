Hey. I'm Brian. Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in the [Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research](https://hopkinspsychedelic.org/) and [Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences](https://pbs.jhu.edu/) trying to figure out how psychedelics change the mind and brain. I'll let you know when I do that. In the meantime, you can check out my publications, posters, talks, sci-comm articles, and more. Don't hesitate to get in touch!
