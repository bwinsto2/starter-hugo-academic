# Figure 1 — Psilocybin reduces TA across the brain during rest but not music listening 

Lag-1 temporal autocorrelation (TA) was measured over the entire resting state and music listening scans at each voxel of the brain. Voxelwise TA was averaged within each of 400 parcels in the Schaefer parcellation and projected to the cortical surface. 

TA change was calculated at each parcel (Psilocyin - Placebo). more details

# Figure 2 – Psilocybin effects on TA are blocked when brain regions entrain to music 

Intersubject Pattern Correlation (pISC) in each parcel was measured as the average correlation between the multivoxel pattern within each 5 TR (11s) window for each pair of subjects, averaged across all subjects and windows. The parcels with the 20 highest pISC values were designated "Music Parcels". 

Split violin plots show the distribution of TA change between drug conditions during rest (left) and music listening (right) in the 20 Music parcels (blue) and the 380 Other parcels. 

We hypothesized that the TA change between Other parcels and Music parcels would be >0 in music listening but not rest. We ran a Monte Carlo simulation in which the test statistic was the mean TA change in Other parcels - mean TA change in Music parcels. For each iteration of the null distribution, we selected 20 parcels at random to be the Music parcels and re-computed the test statistic. We performed this test once for each task: rest and music. The difference was significant in music (p<0.001) but not rest (p=0.1).
